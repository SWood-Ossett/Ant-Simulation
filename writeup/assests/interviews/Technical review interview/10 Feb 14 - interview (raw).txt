Dear SRS/ Alex,
 
The simulation incorporates many relevant biological adaptations of an ant colony and it’s anatomy, physiology and behaviour.
 
For instance, Alex has integrated jaw size and strength, speed of movement, visual field and pheromone detection into his ants, plus he has the colony reinforcing movement towards a food source based on pheromone trails.  Soldier ant have been programmed to follow and attack intruder ant from different species and also to stand guard around a nest or food source.
 
Alex explained that different species have developed from an ancestral species and they all differed in characteristics.
 
Visually the simulation was interesting, but there was a lot of activity and it was difficult to extract a result from the interactions between species easily.  It was recommended that Alex should work towards showing a biological outcome with respect to the competition between species, either showing new species mutating and evolving or a single species occupying a single niche as a result of competition between species.  Alex stated that this would require a lot of work optimising the subroutines and finding their ‘sweet spot’.  It is important that he documents this work as evidence of improving the programme.
 
Overall, an impressive piece of software simulation with lots of relevant biology in it, although there is a danger of too much variation for a visual model.
